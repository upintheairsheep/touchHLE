//! The Core Foundation framework.
//!
//! In Apple's implementation, this is a layer independent of, or below,
//! Foundation, and there is "Toll-Free Bridging" that lets some Foundation
//! types be used as if they were the corresponding Core Foundation types and
//! vice-versa. But in this implementation we will cheat and implement things
//! backwards (Core Foundation on top of Foundation) where we can get away with
//! it.
